    "summary": "Resource leaks—a program does not release resources it previously acquired—are a common kind of bug in Android applications. Even with the help of existing techniques to automatically detect leaks, writing a leak-free program remains tricky. One of the reasons is Android’s event-driven programming model, which complicates the understanding of an application’s overall control flow. In this paper, we present PlumbDroid: a technique to automatically detect and fix resource leaks in Android applications. PlumbDroid uses static analysis to find execution traces that may leak a resource. The information built for detection also undergirds automatically building a fix—consisting of release operations performed at appropriate locations—that removes the leak and does not otherwise affect the application’s usage of the resource. An empirical evaluation on resource leaks from the DroidLeaks curated collection demonstrates that PlumbDroid’s approach is scalable and produces correct fixes for a variety of resource leak bugs. This indicates it can provide valuable support to enhance the quality of Android applications in practice",

    "summary": "A monitoring algorithm is trace-length independent if its space consumption does not depend on the number of events processed. The analysis of many monitoring algorithms has aimed at establishing their trace-length independence. But a trace-length independent monitor's space consumption can depend on characteristics of the trace other than its size. We put forward the stronger notion of event-rate independence, where the monitor's space usage does not depend on the event rate, i.e., the number of events in a fixed time unit. This property is critical for monitoring voluminous streams of events with a high arrival rate. We propose a new algorithm for metric temporal logic (MTL) that is almost event-rate independent, where *almost* denotes a logarithmic dependence on the event rate: the algorithm must store the event rate as a number. Afterwards, we investigate more expressive logics. In particular, we extend linear dynamic logic with past operators and metric features. The resulting metric dynamic logic (MDL) offers the quantitative temporal conveniences of MTL while increasing its expressiveness. We show how to modify our MTL algorithm in a modular way, yielding an almost event-rate independent monitor for MDL. Finally, we compare our algorithms with traditional monitoring approaches, providing empirical evidence that almost event-rate independence matters in practice.",

    "summary": "Counterexamples produced by model checkers can be hard to grasp. Often it is not even evident why a trace violates a specification. We show how to provide easy-to-check evidence for the violation of a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula on a lasso word, based on a novel sound and complete proof system for LTL on lasso words. Valid proof trees in our proof system follow the syntactic structure of the formula and provide insight on why each Boolean or temporal operator is violated or satisfied. We introduce the notion of optimal proofs with respect to a user-specified preference order and identify sufficient conditions for efficiently computing optimal proofs. We design and evaluate an algorithm that performs this computation, demonstrating that it can produce optimal proofs for complex formulas in under a second.",

    "summary": "In this AFP entry, we show how to specify game-based cryptographic security notions and formally prove secure several cryptographic constructions from the literature using the CryptHOL framework. Among others, we formalise the notions of a random oracle, a pseudo-random function, an unpredictable function, and of encryption schemes that are indistinguishable under chosen plaintext and/or ciphertext attacks. We prove the random-permutation/random-function switching lemma, security of the Elgamal and hashed Elgamal public-key encryption scheme and correctness and security of several constructions with pseudo-random functions. Our proofs follow the game-hopping style advocated by Shoup and Bellare and Rogaway, from which most of the examples have been taken. We generalise some of their results such that they can be reused in other proofs. Thanks to CryptHOL's integration with Isabelle's parametricity infrastructure, many simple hops are easily justified using the theory of representation independence.",
